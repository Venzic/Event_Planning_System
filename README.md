# Event_Planning_System
Event Planning System was one of my college projects using MonoDB and Thinkinter to build an window application software that helps couples and family plan weddings by getting budget estimation on all important criteria's during weddings like food, venue, time, location, recent weddings.
The data used for this project was randomly generated to fit all criteria's of the project only because it was not possible at the time to collect real data of weddings, but the feature sets are set ot real life practical implementation worthy.
The Project covers all CRUD opeations in MongoDB simultaneously.

all codes are attached in the Represotry, remember you need all of them to run the project.
